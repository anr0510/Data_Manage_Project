# Input the base and height from the user
base = float(input("Enter the length of the base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
# Calculate the area of the triangle
area = 0.5 * base * height
# Display the result
print(f"The area of the triangle is: {area}")

# We are what will be the value of base
# It can be float or int  or anything
# If the value is float and we want the exact value hence
# Hence we have given it in float
# Area of the triangle is (1/2)*base*height

print(f"The area of the triangle is: {area}")
print(f"The area of the triangle is:", area)
# Bot the above print statement are one and the same
# In first we have used the format method
