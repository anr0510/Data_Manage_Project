# A pronic number, also known as an oblong number or rectangular number, is a type of
# figurate number that represents a rectangle. It is the product of two consecutive integers, n
# and (n + 1). Mathematically, a pronic number can be expressed as:
# For example, the first few pronic numbers are:

# 𝑃𝑛 = 𝑛 ∗ (𝑛 + 1)
# 𝑃1 = 1 ∗ (1 + 1) = 2
# 𝑃2 = 2 ∗ (2 + 1) = 6
# 𝑃3 = 3 ∗ (3 + 1) = 12
# 𝑃4 = 4 ∗ (4 + 1) = 20
